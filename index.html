      <p>Back in 2013, Sébastien, my brother Romain and I decided to launch a coding school to teach creative and entrepreneurially-minded people how to code their own tech products through an intensive 9-week bootcamp. At that time, none of us had real design or branding skills. My brother was a lawyer. Sébastien and I were both engineers (French engineers, aka the worst kind in terms of design background 😬).</p>
      <p>We only knew one thing: we wanted to build a program to teach people the technical skills and tools to bring their ideas to life. This program would go far beyond “becoming a full-stack developer” or “learning UX/UI Design, HTML, CSS, ruby and Javascript”. For us, these skills were also a prerequisite for anyone who wanted to develop tech projects autonomously in their current job, start a freelancing career or launch their own startup. And we felt that traditional degrees’ courses were failing to provide students with these new tech skills. As we say in French…</p>
      <blockquote>🇫🇷 L’éducation supérieure a “un wagon de retard”…
      </blockquote>
      <p>An idiom that could be literally translated into: “Higher education has missed the train”. This was the first time we thought of the word “wagon” for our brand name. After giving it some more thought, it seemed like a cool name for different reasons:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It points to this idea of a “missing block” or “missing wagon” in the “train of higher education”.</li>
        <li>A wagon is a vehicle that takes a group of people (like a class of students) on a journey to a destination. This is exactly what our coding bootcamp is about!</li>
        <li>We didn’t want a brand name using words like “hack”, “code”, “tech”, “app”, etc… For us, code is a means to develop products and reach your goals, not an end in itself.</li>
      </ul>
